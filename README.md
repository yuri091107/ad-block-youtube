#  AdBlocker Script (IN MAINTENCE) 30/09/2024

This project is a lightweight JavaScript script built to function as a browser extension, designed to remove video ads and interactive ad interfaces, primarily targeting video players. It leverages DOM manipulation and the `MutationObserver` API to efficiently detect and remove ads in real-time.

# Features

-   Removes ads in video players (e.g., YouTube).
-   Closes ad overlays and banners.
-   Automatically skips video ads by advancing the player.
-   Eliminates interactive ads that appear during video playback.
-   Uses `MutationObserver` to track and respond to DOM changes instantly.

## Key Ad Selectors Monitored

-   `.ytp-ad-module`: Video player ad container.
-   `.ytp-ad-player-overlay`: Ad overlay in the video player.
-   `.ad-container`: General ad containers.
-   `.video-ads`: Video ad elements.
-   `.ytp-ad-skip-button`: Skip ad button.
-   `.ytp-ad-interrupting`: Ads interrupting the video playback.

## How It Works

The script, intended to be run within a browser extension such as **Tampermonkey** or **Greasemonkey**, monitors the DOM for known ad-related elements and removes them as they appear. When an ad starts playing, it automatically jumps to the end of the ad by adjusting the videoâ€™s current time. It also removes interactive ads and closes ad overlays.
